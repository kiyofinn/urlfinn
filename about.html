        <h1>About Me.</h1>
        <p data-scroll>
            I am a fresh graduate with expertise in graphic design, creative writing, video editing, game development, and web development. 
            During my studies and project experience, I have handled various design needs such as Instagram feeds, brochures, and social media 
            materials for individuals or companies, with a focus on delivering visuals that are attractive, informative, 
            and in line with brand identity.
        </p>
        <p data-scroll>
            Outside of design, I am also active in the writing world and music producing. In addition, I have developed a web application as my final project using HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript, and PHPâ€”an experience that strengthens my understanding as an aspiring fullstack developer. I am used to working with 
            tools such as Canva, Figma, Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, CapCut, and Microsoft Office. I'm also familiar with the FL Studio software and make <a href="projects.html">projects</a> with them.
            I am a fast learner and always eager to learn new things, especially in the field of technology and design.
        </p>

            I have a great interest in a career in the creative industry, whether as a UI Designer, Video Editor, Writer, or Fullstack Developer. 
            I am excited to be involved in a collaborative team, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute through impactful creative 
            and technical solutions. Open to work opportunities and projects that challenge and encourage my professional growth.
